## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. This could help Sparkify make future improvements to its music service by tracking things such as:
- which songs and artists are most popular among Sparkify's users
- variations in song/artist popularity across geographic region
- the music interests of specific users (to inform future music recommendations)
- the listening behavior of free vs. paid users

Our role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. We'll be able to test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare our results with their expected results.


##### &nbsp;

## Goals
In this project, we apply what we've learned on data modeling with Postgres to build an ETL pipeline using Python.

To complete the project, we need to:
1. Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema
2. Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in local directories into these tables

##### &nbsp;

## Project Setup & Instructions

##### &nbsp;

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

##### &nbsp;

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.

```
df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)
```

For example,
```
df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.
```

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, we need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
1. `songplays` &mdash; records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with `page` = `NextSong`
   - *songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent*

#### Dimension Tables
2. `users` &mdash; users in the app
   - *user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level*

3. `songs` &mdash; songs in music database
   - *song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration*

4. `artists` &mdash; artists in music database
   - *artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude*

5. `time` &mdash; timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
   - *start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

##### &nbsp;

### Project Template
The source data files are located in the `/data` directory.  

The following files with the starter code are available in the `/project_template` directory:

- `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
- `create_tables.py` drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
- `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
- `etl.py` reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.
- `sql_queries.py` contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
README.md provides discussion on your project.


##### &nbsp;

## Project Steps
Below are the basic steps to complete the project:

1. **Create Tables**
   1. Write CREATE statements in sql_queries.py to create each table.
   1. Write DROP statements in sql_queries.py to drop each table if it exists.
   1. Run create_tables.py to create your database and tables.
   1. Run test.ipynb to confirm the creation of your tables with the correct columns. Make sure to click "Restart kernel" to close the connection to the database after running this notebook.
1. **Build ETL Processes**
   1. Follow instructions in the etl.ipynb notebook to develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, run test.ipynb to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table.
   1. Remember to rerun create_tables.py to reset your tables before each time you run this notebook.
1. **Build ETL Pipeline**
   1. Use what you've completed in etl.ipynb to complete etl.py, where you'll process the entire datasets. Remember to run create_tables.py before running etl.py to reset your tables.
   1. Run test.ipynb to confirm your records were successfully inserted into each table.

## My Implementation

### Schema Design

* (diagram created using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com)) * 


#### Schema Notes:
- Some of the identity fields are VARCHAR data types, while others are INT. For example, the source data for *song_id* and *artist_id* contain non numeric characters, so these are VARCHAR. Whereas, *user_id* only contains real numbers, so it is setup as an INT data type, and specifically the BIGINT data type to allow for a larger number of users.
- The timestamp data in the log files is recorded as a BIGINT data type. I decided to store it in its original format in the *start_time* field of the `songplays` table. However, it is converted to a timestamp in the *start_time* field of the `time` table &mdash; which makes it easier to derive the other time values (*hour, day, week* etc.)
- The *songs.duration, artists.latitude*, and *artists.longitude* data types are all set to FLOAT. But, for some reason when I export the schema information they show as data type DOUBLE. I couldn't figure out why this happens. Perhaps it's a bug in psycopg2. Regardless, it does not negatively affect the pipeline (other than allotting more space than is needed).



### Example Queries
Here are some examples of queries I used in my implementation.

```python
## create `songplays` fact table

songplay_table_create = ("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS songplays (
    PRIMARY KEY (songplay_id),
    songplay_id  SERIAL,
    start_time   BIGINT          NOT NULL,
    user_id      INT             NOT NULL,
    level        VARCHAR(50)     NOT NULL,
    song_id      VARCHAR(100)    NOT NULL,
    artist_id    VARCHAR(100)    NOT NULL,
    session_id   BIGINT          NOT NULL,
    location     TEXT,
    user_agent   TEXT)
""")
```

```python
# find songs and artists that match records extracted from log files

song_select = ("""SELECT songs.song_id, artists.artist_id FROM songs
JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id=artists.artist_id
WHERE songs.title=%s
AND artists.name=%s
AND songs.duration=%s
""")
```

```python
# insert the results from the `song_select` query above into the `songplays` table

songplay_table_insert = ("""
    INSERT INTO songplays (start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
    ON CONFLICT (songplay_id)
    DO UPDATE
    SET start_time=EXCLUDED.start_time, user_id=EXCLUDED.user_id, level=EXCLUDED.level, song_id=EXCLUDED.song_id, artist_id=EXCLUDED.artist_id, session_id=EXCLUDED.session_id, location=EXCLUDED.location, user_agent=EXCLUDED.user_agent
""")
```



### ETL Output
Here is the output after running `etl.py`. You can see that there's only one record inserted into the `songplays` table. This means, there's only one song within all 30 of the log files that matches any of the records in the `songs` table. Although this is the correct result, it's a bit disappointing. I wish Udacity had setup the project so there are hundreds of matches. It would make the analysis more interesting.  

```
songplay row inserted:
[483] (1542837407796, '15', 'paid', 'SOZCTXZ12AB0182364', 'AR5KOSW1187FB35FF4', 818, 'Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI', '"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/36.0.1985.125 Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36"')

---------
total log records checked in this file = 437
total rows inserted = 1
26/30 files processed.
```
